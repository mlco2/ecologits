# EcoLogits and CodeCarbon are joining forces

The year 2025 was a milestone for EcoLogits. We saw **growing adoption**, **formed new partnerships**, and **made significant methodological progress**. More organizations than ever are now using EcoLogits to estimate and reduce the environmental footprint of generative AI.

Today we are pleased to announce a major step forward: **EcoLogits is joining the CodeCarbon non-profit**. This collaboration unites two complementary initiatives, driven by a shared commitment to scientific excellence. Together, we **aim to make environmental impact assessment for AI more accessible**, **transparent**, and **effective** by building open source tools that are robust and widely trusted.

This alliance expands our technical and partnership capabilities, strengthens our methodological expertise, and increases our collective impact on the responsible digital ecosystem.
